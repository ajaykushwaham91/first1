# Dental
Creating a dental website as your first project using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, jQuery, Python, MySQL, and Django is a fantastic way to showcase your skills! The site can include sections like Home, Services, About Us, Contact, and Appointment Booking. Use HTML and CSS for the structure and design, Bootstrap for responsive layouts, and jQuery for interactive features. Python and Django will handle the backend, managing user data and appointments, while MySQL stores patient records securely. Ensure the website is visually appealing, user-friendly, and emphasizes trust and professionalism, which are essential for a dental practice.
